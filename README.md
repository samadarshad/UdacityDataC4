# Project - Data Lake

This project is an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. We will load json data from S3, process the data into fact & dimension tables using Spark, and load them back into S3 as parquet files.

## ETL Pipeline
    
1.  Read data from S3
    
    -   Song data:  `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
    -   Log data:  `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
    
    The script reads song_data and load_data from S3.
    
3.  Process data using spark
    
    Transforms them to create five different tables listed below : 
    #### Fact Table
	 **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

	#### Dimension Tables
	 **users**  - users in the app
		Fields -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
		
	 **songs**  - songs in music database
    Fields - _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
    
	**artists**  - artists in music database
    Fields -   _artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude_
    
	  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    Fields -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_
    
4.  Load it back to S3
    
    Writes them to partitioned parquet files in table directories on S3.
